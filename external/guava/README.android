Description: "Guava: Google Core Libraries for Java 1.5"

Local Modifications: Minor hacks to compile on our Mac build machines --
   see src/com/google/common/collect/Immutable*.java, look for
   "BEGIN/END android-changed" markers.

Guava-libraries are a grab bag of utility libraries published by Google as
open source, including among other things the Google collections libraries.

This code is built as a static library.
